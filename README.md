### How to start the project
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open it it Visual Studio and run the application.
There will be no need for input, the application will 
print the examples/write in the coresponding text file.

#### Question 1
I have created the mock data that was required, overrode
the ToString() method and printed all the new objects;

#### Question 2
I have created the corresponding letter input files (letter1.txt, letter2.txt, letter3.txt).
After that, I call the method ReadLetter(string) from SantaClaus class (which in my application represents the controller) and print the name of the children.

#### Question 3
I have recreated the mock data from the first question, added it to the list of children from the SantaClaus class and after that call the GenerateLetters(string) method to write the files.

#### Question 4
I have printed the report on both the console and report.txt. 

#### Question 5
I have implemented the Singleton pattern on SantaClaus class and commented the arguments for using it in the corresponding function.

#### Question 5
Created the logic part in the method createTravelItinerary() from SantaClaus class and after that iterated through the resulting dictionary for creating the text. I have printed it on both the screen and in the file itinerary.txt
